                    <p> <b>During : </b> Cloud Computing course, 2016 </p>
                    <p> <b>Project Describtion:</b> Abstract: many of the state-of-art researches and methodologies concentrated on enhancing the utilization of resources in cloud datacenters, such techniques might contribute also in enhancing the power consumption of the datacenter. VM migrations and consolidation are two methods have been used separately because of the sense that consolidating VMs in one PM should be free of SLA violations. Here in this paper we first prove that migrations can be forecasted if the underlying traffic pattern has been forecasted. Then we introduce and algorithm that combines both live migration and consolidation to improve both the energy consumption and resource utilization. This work is basically a continuing on a previous work about consolidating complementary VMs.</p>

                    <p> <b>During : </b> Information Retreival course, 2016</p>
                    <p> <b>Project Describtion:</b> ABSTRACT:
            In the past few years, sentiment analysis and opinion mining
            become an initial issue for companies and governments to
            measure people's opinion through their blogging on the social
            media. So we thought why not use this idea for sensing political
            relations between countries and see if there is coming war or
            disturb in the relations. In this paper, we describe a methodology
            to retrieve the political relations between two countries based on
            sentiment analysis. We show how to retrieve, process and
            sentimentally analyses data from Twitter to measure the relations.
            We conduct some real world experiments and sensitivity analysis
            to increase the confident and robustness of our results.</p>

                    <p> <b>Project Describtion:</b> Abstract: Advances in technology have enabled the production of massive volumes of valuable metocean data
            through both observations and simulations. On average, every
            ten minutes there are new measurements to be added to the
            database, resulting with a volume of hundreds of terabytes. Thus,
            this research intends to study the structure of metocean data
            aiming at finding a potential solution that can compress the data
            at real-time and maintain a space-efficient and fast retrieval
            database. It will also include performing experiments with a
            number of real metocean datasets, query sets, and parameters to
            show the effect that varying these characteristics has on analysis
            results.
